        <p>Hi! If the header at the top wasn't enough indication, my name is James Calingo (or "JC" as all the cool kids call me). Currently, I'm an aspiring web developer who doesn't really know much about web development, so I'm learning it at Rutgers Coding Bootcamp</p>
  
        <p>When I'm not trying to figure out why things aren't working and hoping that my computer isn't on fire, I like music, video games, and some third thing that I can't think of right now because I need three things because that's how I set this sentence up.</p>
  
        <p>Also, that's not a photo of me. That's a cat.</p>
